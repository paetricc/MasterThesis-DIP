# üìò Master's thesis

This repository contains the implementation and final document for my Master's thesis: **"Quantum-Inspired Optimization Algorithms"** defended at BUT FIT (Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology).

The thesis explores classical optimization techniques inspired by principles of quantum computing.
